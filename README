1. Description
==============

Argonaut is a blogging engine built with Pylons. It is lightweight
and can be deployed on many types of web servers running Python.

The application is still very much in alpha stages and as such 
there are bugs in the system and a lot of features which have 
not been implemented.

- Mako (templates, the View) [http://www.makotemplates.org/]

Of these the JavaScript components CKEditor, jQuery, pwi and AddToAny are
distributed along with this package. The Python components are downloaded
and installed by easy_install.


3.3 Installation and Setup
--------------------------

Prequisites for install must be fulfilled. Install Argonaut using easy_install:

    easy_install argonaut
    
       OR with local .egg file
       
    easy_install <path_to_egg_file>

Make a config file as follows:

    paster make-config argonaut config.ini

Tweak the config file as appropriate. Please see Pylons application
setup pages for hints on editing the config file [http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/].
After this run the following to setup the application:

    paster setup-app config.ini#arg

Then you are ready to go.

You can test the installation by running:

    paster serve config.ini

After this visit the link http://127.0.0.1:5000

Optionally you can extract the source and run Argonaut by launching development
mode via setup.py. Just extract the source, install Pylons and in the Argonaut
base directory run:
    
    python setup.py develop
    paster serve development.ini


4. Updating from a previous version
===================================

TBD


5. Usage
========

5.1 Modifying the site
----------------------

Argonaut features templates that can be used to control the site
structure, layout and texts. Unfortunately in this early version
there is no admin panel so all editing must be made to the files
directly.

Template files are situated in argonaut/templates. Please see
Mako documentation on how to change the templates.


5.2 Configuration
-----------------

During application setup a database will be created in the form
that is configured in config.ini. In addition to blog data, Argonaut
also stores some configuration values in the database. These are 
stored in the table 'config'.


5.3 Users
---------

The default user for writing posts is 'admin', password 'admin'.
Currently users can only be added directly to the database. An
admin panel will be added later.


5.4 Other usage notes
---------------------

Proper documentation and usage will be added slowly over
future releases :)

      http://shane.caraveo.com/2010/09/13/database-migrations-for-sqlalchemy-part-duex/
    - Default landing page is now the one with the lowest page_order setting.

      'tags'.
    - Page urls are now determined from page type, but can also be customised.

      which redirects traffic to a mako template file as indicated in the pages table.

      Removed these text strings and urls from the configuration table and placed them in
      the base template.
    Updating from version 0.2:
    - Pre-upgrade the database table 'pages' needs to be dropped for an easy upgrade. After
      this the script 'paster setup-app [config_file]#arg' needs to be run to create the
      table with the new schema. The rest of the database changes should be handled by
      the automatic schema update mechanism.
